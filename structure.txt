1. I store objects with whole their properties of AI models into pickle file and 
funcitons interact with objects after import them with functions in src/train.py. 
But initailization function of models is in init_models in parent folder

2. For development svm_predict and rf_predict functions are exactly same with
functions inside update_models function in train.py. For reduce duplicated
code this will be fix future.

3. Code inside svm_predict and rf_predict in dectect.py do exact same thing at this 
time but they might change once better approaches are founded.

4. Maybe a better way to deal with new payloads is store them in a file and
so WAF will not update models every time receive new request
